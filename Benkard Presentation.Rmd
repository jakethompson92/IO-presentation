## Motivation

- Empirical: firms often sell jetliners below static marginal cost, in contrast to standard models of firms in competition or oligopoly
- Lockheed L-1011 sold for below average variable cost for entire production run!

##Motivation cont. 

- Policy: airlines are the target of industrial policy
- Past theoretical literature finds that under certain conditions an unrestrained monopoly may pareto-dominate an oligopoly

## Empirical Strategy

- Develop dynamic model with learning curves, differentiated products, entry costs, and closed loop strategic interaction
- Estimate the primitives of the model
- Find equilibrium 

## Theoretical Model
- Dynamic programming problem
- Products indexed by $j \in \mathbb{N}$, time periods indexed by $t \in \mathbb{N}$
- Three state variables per product, experience with product-j 
- $E_{jt} \in \mathcal{E}$,
- the product's "type" $\mu_j \in \mathcal{A}$ and 
- the product's quality $\xi_{jt} \in \mathcal{X}$
- Sets $\mathcal{E}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{X}$ are sets of possible experience levels, product types and product quality levels. 

## Incumbent's Bellman system

- $$V(i,s,M)=max_{\chi_i^e,\chi_j,q_j\forall j\in \mathcal{J}_i}\{-\sum_{k=1}^31\{\chi^e_i=k\}x_k^e$$ $$ + \sum_{j\in\mathcal{J}_i}[\chi_j\Phi_{jt}+(1-\chi_j)\pi_j(i,s,q,M)]$$  $$+ \beta \sum_{i',s',M'}V(i',s',M')\mathcal{P}(i',s',M'\vert i,s,q,M,\chi,\chi^e)\}$$

## Incumbent Bellman, cont. 

- State variables are: $\mathcal{J}_i$ is set of products owned by firm $i$, 
- $\mathcal{M}$ is aggregate plane demand
- $\phi_{jt}$ is a random scrap-value for each product
- $s_t$ is a vector whose length equals the number of possible firm-specific state-vectors
- Each element of $s_t$ indicates the number of firms for which the possible state vector is the actual state vector


## Incumbent Bellman, cont.  

- Control variables are: exit rules, $\chi_{jt}\in\{0,1\}$ 
- quantities oproduced $q_{jt}\in\mathbb{R}^+$
- entry rules $x^i_{it}\in\{0,1,2,3\}$, 0, 1, 2, and 3 denote no entry, entry into small, medium, and wide-body jetliners
- $\mathcal{P}$ denotes the transition probabilities for the future states. 
- Is a more specific expression of $\beta E_t V(i_{t+1},s_{t+1},M_{t+1})$

## Potential Entrant's Bellman system

- $$V^e(s,M)=max_{\chi_i^e\in\{0,1,2,3\}}-\sum_{k=1}^31\{\chi_i^e=k\}x_k^e$$ $$+\beta\sum_{i',s',M'}V(i^e,s',M')\mathcal{P}(i^e,s',M'|s,q,M,\chi,\chi^e)$$

## Profit function

$$\pi_j(i,s,q,M)=p_j(i,s,q,M)q_j-c_j(i,q_j)$$

## Equilibrium

- Model restricts equilibria to "Markov-perfect Nash Equilibrium(MPE)"
- MPE $\subset$ SPNE; best-response functions function only of payoff relevant state-variables
- Further estrict equilibria further to symmetric equilibria
- Equilibria symmetric if strategies for any two identical firms facing identical states are likewise identical. 

## Estimating the model

- labor requirements are characterized by: $$lnL_{lt}=lnA+\theta lnE_t+\gamma lnS_t+\varepsilon_{lt}$$
- $L_{lt}$ is labor input for good $l$ at time $t$, $A$ is a constant, $E_t$ is experience, $\varepsilon_{lt}$ is a plane-specific productivity shock, $S_t$ is line-speed or the production rate. 

## Learning by doing

- $E_{t+1} = \delta E_t + q_t$ characterizes the evolution of the stock of experience
- This process captures organizational "forgetting"
- Intuition: turnover, lay-offs, and forgetting rarely-repeated tasks can cause effective experience to decline
- Benkard(2000) estimates the monthly depreciation factor $\delta = .96$ for a total yearly depreciation of $.613=.96^{12}$
- learning parameter $\theta$ estimated to be -.63, and $\gamma$ estimated to be .11, indicating slightly increasing returns to scale. 
- to simplify the state space, Benkard defines $\mathcal{E} = \{1,10,20,40,70,110,165\}$

## Estimation of Labor requirements

## Demand for Commercial Aircraft

- Author eschews product-characteristic discrete choice model 
- Individual planes often change operators
- Treat aircraft purchases instead as rentals 
- nested logit discrete choice model is estimated
- Assumes that aircraft purchases are independent even within the same firm
- Benkard(1996) argues that this assumption is relatively innocuous. 
- nested logit includes two groups(nests), new and used (or narrow) planes
- generates more reasonable substitution patterns over standard logit

## Estimation cont.

- Utility of a plane is denoted $u_{ijt} = x_{jt}\beta-\alpha p_{jt} + \xi_{jt}+\zeta_{igt}+(1-\lambda)\varepsilon_{ijt}$
- $x_{jt}$ are observed qualities of the plane
- $\xi_{jt}$ are unobserved qualities of plane
- $\zeta_{igt}$ are unobserved group-specific tastes
- $\varepsilon_{ijt}$ are group-plane-specific tastes

## Estimation cont. 

- Use GMM with an optimal weighting matrix with the following moment restriction: $$E[\xi_{jt}|Z_{jt},\theta_0]=0$$

-Instruments include plane characteristics, wage rates, price of aluminium, and a model's time since rollout

## Alternative market structures

- True market structure is compared to multi-product monopolist and multi-product social planner
- Unrestricted monopolist produces greater surplus than the oligopolistic market
- Consumers better off under actual market structure, but firms far worse off
- Consumers even better off under Social plannner but firm worse off
- Result of increasing returns to scale created by learning curve

## Anti-trust policy

![](C:\\Users\\jthom\\Pictures\\anti-trust)

## Anti-trust policy cont. 

- Note that actual concentration ratios do not change substantially
- Primary result is reduction in supply by dominant firm
- Table 9 re-simulates the model under alternative parameterizations
- Only discount rate creates problems; larger $\beta$ causes more entry

## Summary

- Dynamic oligopoly with learning curve
- Predicts many observed features of commercial jet industry
- Concrete policy implications for anti-trust enforcement and litigation
